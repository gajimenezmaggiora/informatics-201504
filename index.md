How do we ensure that these changes are <span class="underline">fully</span> validated?

---

# Validation

---

## Initial Validation

* Completed in December 2012
* Focused on Core Modules and Functionality:
    * Electronic Data Capture (EDC)
    * Queries
    * Audit Trail
    * Data Export
    * Document Repository
    * Authentication and Authorization
    * Meta-data Management

---

## Initial Validation

* Initial timeline: 3 months
* Actual time to completion: 9 months
* Traditional approach
    * Manual test execution
    * Paper-based
* Required 50k+ person hours

---

## Initial Validation

* Observations:
    * Traditional approach is resource intensive and difficult to replicate
    * Our user community demands constant innovation
    * Our business requirements are evolving and study-specific

---

## Initial Validation

* Observations:
    * By design, we have a key dependency on web browsers, which are rapidly changing\*:
      * Firefox releases a new version every 6 weeks
      * Chrome has had 4 new releases in the past 6 months

![Browser Updates](./images/browser-updates.png)

---

## Initial Validation

* Conclusions:
    * Develop a new approach that effectively combines processes, standards and technology to maintain a continuous, documented, reproducible, and structured quality review of our clinical trials data management system
    * Furthermore, this new approach should allow us to rapidly validate new functionality and browser versions
